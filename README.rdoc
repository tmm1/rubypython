= RubyPython: Python in your Ruby

== Description

RubyPython is a bridge between the Ruby and Python interpreters. It embeds a
running Python interpreter in the application's process using FFI and provides
a means for wrapping and converting Python objects.

RubyPython uses FFI to marshall the data between the Ruby and Python VMs and
make Python calls. Recently, RubyPython has added the ability to:

* Inherit from Python classes;
* Configure callbacks from Python;
* Run Python generators (on Ruby 1.9.2 or later).

== Where

RubyPython can be found on {RubyForge}[http://rubypython.rubyforge.org/] and on
{RubyGems}[http://rubygems.org/gems/rubypython]. The source for RubyPython is
hosted both on {Bitbucket}[http://raineszm.bitbucket.org/rubypython/] and on
{GitHub}[https://github.com/halostatue/rubypython], although the BitBucket
repository should be considered canonical.

== Synopsis

=== Basic Usage

  require "rubypython"

  RubyPython.start # start the Python VM

  cPickle = RubyPython.import("cPickle")
  p cPickle.dumps("Testing rubypython").rubify

  RubyPython.stop # stop the Python VM

=== Specific Python Version

  require "rubypython"

  RubyPython.start(:python => "python2.7") # Can also be a full path

  cPickle = RubyPython.import("cPickle")
  p cPickle.dumps("Testing rubypython").rubify

  RubyPython.stop # stop the Python VM

=== VirtualEnv

  # Easy
  RubyPython.start_from_virtualenv("/path/to/virtualenv")

  # Or verbose
  RubyPython.start(:python => "/path/to/virtualenv/bin/python")
  RubyPython.activate

=== Iterator support

  # Python
  def readfile():
    for line in open("/some/file"):
      yield line

  # Ruby
  readfile.to_enum.each do |line|
    puts line
  end


=== Python to Ruby callbacks

  # Python
  def dosomething(callback):
    print callback(5)

  # Ruby
  dosomething(lambda do |value|
    value * 2
  end)

  def mycallback(value)
    return value * 2
  end

  dosomething(method(:mycallback))

=== Python-style Generators

  # Python
  def test_generator(callback):
    for i in callback():
      print "Got %d" % i

  # Ruby
  test_generator(RubyPython.generator do
    (0..10).each do |i|
      RubyPython.yield i
    end
  end)

=== Python named arguments (experimental!)

  # Python
  def foo(arg1, arg2):
    pass

  # Ruby
  foo!(:arg2 => "bar2", :arg1 => "bar1")

  # with Ruby 1.9
  foo!(arg2: "bar2", arg1: "bar1")

== Features / Problems

=== Features

* Can handle simple conversion of Python builtin types to Ruby builtin types
  and vice versa
* Can import Python modules
* Can execute arbitrary methods on imported modules and return the result
* Python objects can be treated as Ruby objects!
* Python's standard library available to you from within Ruby.
* Pass Ruby methods and procs as callbacks and call them from within Python
  code.
* Specify the python executable to be loaded, including virtualenv.

=== Known Problems

* Builtin Python methods which require a top level frame object (eval, dir,
  ...) do not work properly at present.
* There is no support for passing complicated (non-basic) Ruby types to Python.

== Supported Versions

=== Python
RubyPython is known to work with the C-based Python interpreter, versions 2.4 through
2.7; no work has yet been done to enable Python 3.0 support or to work with
alternative Python implementations.

=== Ruby
RubyPython is known to work with the C-based (MRI) Ruby interpreter on versions 1.8.7
and 1.9.2. However, it uses Ruby-FFI, so it may work with other implementations
without modification.

== What's planned
There are features that are not currently supported in RubyPython that may be
considered for future releases, dependent on need, interest, and solutions.

=== Simpler Imports
It might be nice to have some nice import helpers provided by RubyPython to make the
interface more seamless and provide advanced import features:

==== Import Aliasing

  # Python
  from mod2.mod1 import sym as mysym

  # Ruby
  py :from => "mod2.mod1", :import => "sym", :as => "mysym"
  py :from => "mod2.mod1", :import => :sym, :as => :mysym
  py :from => [ :mod2, :mod1 ], :import => :sym, :as => :mysym

  # Python
  import mod1 as mymod

  # Ruby
  py :import => "mod1", :as => "mymod"
  py :import => :mod1, :as => :mymod

  # Python
  from mod2.mod1 import *

  # Ruby
  py :from => "mod2.mod1", :import => :*
  pyrequire "mod2/mod1" # ruby style imports

=== Catch Exceptions from Ruby

  # Python
  class MyFirstException(Exception):
    pass

  class MySecondException(MyFirstException):
    pass

  def test():
    raise MySecondException

  # Ruby
  begin
    test
  rescue MyFirstException => e
    # We may need to work out name collisions
    puts e.message
  end

== Requirements

* Python >= 2.4, < 3.0
* Ruby >= 1.8.6
* You must be able to build the ffi gem under your environment.

Note: RubyPython has been tested on Mac OS 10.5, Mac OS 10.6, and Ubuntu 10.10
(64-bit Intel).

== Install
